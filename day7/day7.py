#Notes
#Part A Notes
#So we're playing some poker!  Camel poker that is.  Our jobs here is to calculate the total 
#winnings of each game. To start we'll take all the hands and 
#order them by strength.  Standard poker levels apply here but the tie resolution is different. 
#in a tie, we go by each individual charater from the left and see whats higher. Once the order is 
#figured, we just need to multiply the rank by the bid (int to the right of the hand)
#and then add up all our winnings.   OK!
